# LeetCode Solutions (C++)

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions, primarily implemented in **C++**. This repository serves as a personal log of my journey to sharpen my data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills, improve my problem-solving capabilities, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Table of Contents

## Goals

This repository is part of my focused effort to:

* **Master Fundamental Algorithms & Data Structures:** Develop a deep understanding of core DSA concepts and their practical applications.
* **Enhance Algorithmic Thinking:** Improve my ability to break down complex problems, identify efficient solutions, and analyze their time and space complexity.
* **Boost Interview Readiness:** Practice coding under pressure and articulate my thought process clearly, preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies.
* **Track Learning Progress:** Maintain a structured record of solved problems to review and reinforce concepts.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized to provide clear navigation and easy access:

```

Each problem's solution file (`solution.cpp`) aims to be clear, concise, and well-commented.

## My Approach to Problem Solving

For each problem, I generally follow these steps:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** Read carefully, identify inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases.
2.  **Example Walkthrough:** Work through 1-2 examples manually to solidify understanding.
3.  **High-Level Plan:** Brainstorm potential approaches (e.g., brute force, greedy, dynamic programming, specific data structures).
4.  **Detailed Plan:** Select the optimal approach, outline the algorithm steps, and consider time/space complexity.
5.  **Code Implementation:** Write clean, readable, high performance and no memory leak C++ code.
6.  **Testing:** Test with provided examples and my own custom test cases.
7.  **Review & Refine:** Analyze the solution for potential improvements, simplify code, and ensure it handles all edge cases.
